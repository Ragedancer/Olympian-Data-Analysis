# Olympian Data Analysis
For my Advanced Data Analytics class taken in Spring 2020, I did my study on Olympians over the course of 120 years. My primary focus was on weightlifting, because I participated in Olympic competitive weightlifting.

# Dataset

This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.

Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/data).

The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events). The columns are:

**ID** - Unique number for each athlete

**Name** - Athlete's name

**Sex** - M or F

**Age** - Integer

**Height** - In centimeters

**Weight** - In kilograms

**Team** - Team name

# Scrubbing the Dataset
